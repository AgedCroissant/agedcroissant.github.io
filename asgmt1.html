        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <a title="Doctor-of-Philosophy">PhD</a> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
     
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
         
        <ul>
            <li>First semester:<time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester:<time datetime="2016-01-15"> 15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester:<time datetime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>
         
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
